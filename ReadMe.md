# A comprehensive behavioral authentication system for the web (working title)

## Background:
This is a thesis that aims to improve the login system of websites by measuring user data. The thesis proposes that by measuring user data during the login process and comparing it past data measured from previous login attempts, an authentication system can be developed that is able to determine if a login attempt was conducted by the account owner or a malicious attacker.


## Data Collection
Volunteers are to be informed that the following data is measured and stored.

- Typing speed
- Timestamps of typed characters
- Mouse movement speed
- Amount of times mouse is moved
- Browser Type (Firefox, Chrome, etc)
- OS type (macOS, Windows, etc)


## Instructions

You will be given a username and password

In the first phase, you will be asked to log in to the training site 20 times in order to train the database with your data.

In the second phase, you will be asked to log in to the testing site 20 times to test the accuracy of the authentication system.

In the third and final phase, you will be given a new set of credentials and asked to log in 20 times to test the accuracy of the detection system.

## VERY Important Notes
**Instead of using back-space to correct mis-typings, please refresh the page.**

It is suggested to practice before the first phase to type out the username and password a few times to become used to typing it. 

Try to type as naturally as possible.

Try not to rush through the process, treat each login as it’s own ‘attempt’.

Do not copy and paste
